# WHAT IS THAT

Get your KAT torrents without all the advertising crap. Type "kat" followed by what you're looking for, wait a bit (it's quick), choose your torrent and make some space on your HD.

# WHY IS THAT

There's a [KAT workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/kat-search) already on [packal.org](http://www.packal.org), but it doesn't work for me (SSL error). I contacted the author but got no answer, so I built this one. If the other one on Packal works it might be better to use it, it might have more options, or maybe not, I don't know, la la la la la.

# SETUP

NO SETUP! But the KAT URL is an Alfred workflow variable so you can replace it with a mirror in case the main site is down.
